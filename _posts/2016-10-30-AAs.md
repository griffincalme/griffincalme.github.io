title: Generating All Possible Amino Acid Sequences of A Given Length
---

I must be on a bit of a combinatorics kick lately.
Anyways, peptides.

There are 20 regular amino acids coded for by the universal genetic language. These aren't the only amino acids, there are [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenocysteine][two] [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrolysine][others] that can make up natural peptide sequences, but we don't talk about those much.
There are also non-protein-forming "amino acids" like [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid][GABA], D-isomers of the amino acids, post-translational amino acids, and even synthetic amino acids.
Suffice to say, it's complicated.

There are *a lot* of different proteins out there, databases like [http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640][uniprot] have catalogued 70,940 different known proteins for humans alone.
The reason for this great diversity is twofold; there are 20 different amino acids in regular use and each amino acid added to a peptide chain multiplies the possible combinations by 20.
What this means is that for every protein that has a function, there are vastly more sequences that do nothing.

Let's look at insulin as an example. Human insulin, a "small" protein of 51 amino acids, aids in the control of blood glucose levels.
It is released by Î²-cells in the pancreas in response to glucose. 
If we were to generate all the other possible amino acids of this length, we'd have 20^51 (minus 1 for insulin) different polypeptides.


That's a lot. There are only an estimated 10^50 [http://www.fnal.gov/pub/science/inquiring/questions/atoms.html][1] atoms on earth


Permutations: order matters, you can't reuse objects 
example: possible ways of doing my morning routine, brush teeth then shower then eat? or eat then brush then shower?

Combinations: order doesn't matter, you can't reuse objects
example: which of the brands of pencils to throw in my bag?

Sequences: order matters, you can reuse objects
example: my pin code, no I'm not gonna link that [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ][here]


So I guess a _combination_ lock is really a _sequence_ lock

A sequence is the Cartesian product of a set with itself

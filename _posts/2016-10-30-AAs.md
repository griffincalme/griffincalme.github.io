title: Generating All Possible Amino Acid Sequences of A Given Length
---

I must be on a bit of a combinatorics kick lately.
Anyways, peptides.

There are 20 regular amino acids coded for by the universal genetic language. These aren't the only amino acids, there are [two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenocysteine) [others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrolysine) that can make up natural peptide sequences, but we don't talk about those much.
There are also non-protein-forming "amino acids" like [GABA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid), D-isomers of the amino acids, post-translational amino acids, and even synthetic amino acids.
Suffice to say, it's complicated.

### The 20 Amino Acids

| Amino Acid    | Three-Letter  | One-Letter |
| :------------ |:-------------:| ----------:|
| Alanine       | Ala           | A          |
| Cysteine      | Cys           | C          |
| Aspartic Acid | Asp           | D          |
| Glutamic Acid | Glu           | E          |
| Phenylalanine | Phe           | F          |
| Glycine       | Gly           | G          |
| Histidine     | His           | H          |
| Isoleucine    | Ile           | I          |
| Aspartic Acid | Asp           | K          |
| Leucine       | Leu           | L          |
| Methionine    | Met           | M          |
| Asparagine    | Asn           | N          |
| Proline       | Pro           | P          |
| Glutamine     | Gln           | Q          |
| Arginine      | Arg           | R          |
| Serine        | Ser           | S          |
| Threonine     | Thr           | T          |
| Valine        | Val           | V          |
| Tryptophan    | Trp           | W          |
| Tyrosine      | Tyr           | Y          |



There are *a lot* of different proteins out there, databases like [UniProt](http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640) have catalogued 70,940 different known proteins for humans alone.
The reason for this great diversity is twofold; there are 20 different amino acids in regular use, and each amino acid added to a peptide chain multiplies the possible combinations by 20.
What this means is that for every protein with a function, there are vastly more sequences that do nothing.

Let's look at insulin as an example. Human insulin, a "small" protein of 51 amino acids, aids in the control of blood glucose levels.
It is released by β-cells in the pancreas in response to glucose. 
If we were to generate all the other possible amino acids of this length, we'd have 20⁵¹ - 1(for insulin) different polypeptides.


That's a lot. There are only an estimated 10⁵⁰ [[1]](http://www.fnal.gov/pub/science/inquiring/questions/1atoms.html) atoms on earth. I don't think you need me to tell you that computing all of those would be extremely difficult. Sequences 7 or smaller, however, are completely do-able.

###The Combinatorics Part


There are several different enumerative methods, or ways of arranging items.

**_Some of these are:_**

Permutations--order matters, you can't reuse objects 
Example: Possible ways of doing my morning routine; brush teeth, then shower, then eat? or eat, then brush, then shower?

Combinations--order doesn't matter, you can't reuse objects
Example: I need some pencils for the exam tomorrow, which should I throw in my bag?

Sequences--order matters, you can reuse objects
Example: My bank PIN, no I'm not gonna link that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)


>I guess a _combination_ lock is really a _sequence_ lock

So DNA, RNA, and proteins are all sequences, who would have thought...

In protein-ese "A-C-D-E" is different from "E-D-C-A" because we understand that by convention the left-to-right sequence goes from N-terminus to C-terminus.
We can also reuse letters to make sequences like "Y-Y-Y-Y-Y"


###Getting to the Code

A sequence is the Cartesian product of a set with itself

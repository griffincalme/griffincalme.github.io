title: Generating All Possible Amino Acid Sequences of A Given Length
---

I must be on a bit of a combinatorics kick lately.
Anyways, peptides.

There are 20 regular amino acids coded for by the universal genetic language. These aren't the only amino acids, there are [two](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selenocysteine) [others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrrolysine) that can make up natural peptide sequences, but we don't talk about those much.
There are also non-protein-forming "amino acids" like [GABA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid), D-isomers of the amino acids, post-translational amino acids, and even synthetic amino acids.
Suffice to say, it's complicated.

There are *a lot* of different proteins out there, databases like [UniProt](http://www.uniprot.org/proteomes/UP000005640) have catalogued 70,940 different known proteins for humans alone.
The reason for this great diversity is twofold; there are 20 different amino acids in regular use, and each amino acid added to a peptide chain multiplies the possible combinations by 20.
What this means is that for every protein with a function, there are vastly more sequences that do nothing.

Let's look at insulin as an example. Human insulin, a "small" protein of 51 amino acids, aids in the control of blood glucose levels.
It is released by Î²-cells in the pancreas in response to glucose. 
If we were to generate all the other possible amino acids of this length, we'd have 20<sup>51</sup>--minus 1 for insulin--different polypeptides.


That's a lot. There are only an estimated 10^50 [[1]](http://www.fnal.gov/pub/science/inquiring/questions/atoms.html) atoms on earth


Permutations--order matters, you can't reuse objects 
Example: Possible ways of doing my morning routine; brush teeth, then shower, then eat? or eat, then brush, then shower?

Combinations--order doesn't matter, you can't reuse objects
Example: I need some pencils for the exam tomorrow, which should I throw in my bag?

Sequences--order matters, you can reuse objects
Example: My bank PIN, no I'm not gonna link that [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

So DNA, RNA, and proteins are all sequences, huh who would have thought...
A sequence is the Cartesian product of a set with itself

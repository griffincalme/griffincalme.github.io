title: Analyzing The Probability Distribution of Drug Prices
---

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) publish open datasets, found at [data.cms.gov](https://data.medicaid.gov). These datasets include everything from drug prices to drug utilization and quality reports. 

Today, we're going to take a quick look at the drug pricing data to see what the landscape of "National Average Drug Acquisition Cost" (NADAC) looks like. 

There are [many](http://pharmaceuticalcommerce.com/legal-regulatory/analyzing-drug-pricing-mechanisms/) ways to measure drug prices, and pharmacies or institutions rarely pay the price published by manufacturers (AWP). Drug prices are sometimes reported in [Average Wholesale Price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_wholesale_price_(pharmaceuticals)) (AWP) or Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC). 

The [NADAC](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid-chip-program-information/by-topics/prescription-drugs/ful-nadac-downloads/nadacmethodology.pdf) is a national average price for what community pharmacies paid distributors or manufacturers for each drug.

We're going to look at the [probability density function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function) of drug prices, which is a continuous distribution with NADAC price on the X-axis and density of NADAC prices on the Y-axis. 

This is estimated using the [kernel density estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation) (KDE), since each drug price is a discrete value and the data is not truly continuous.

## Downloading the data
Go to [here](https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/prescription-drugs/pharmacy-pricing/index.html) to see the pricing info for each month, scroll down to "National Average Drug Acquisition Cost" and click on the most recent dataset.

## The Code
### Import our modules
I'm using the 64-bit Anaconda distribution of `Python 3.5.3`

`pandas` for loading/munging the data.

`seaborn` for generating the kernel density estimate plot.

`matplotlib` since we need it to define our labels and stuff, seaborn works on top of matplotlib.

`NumPy` arrays to feed our drug price data to seaborn.

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

### Read the CSV
Be sure that your python file is in the same folder as the csv if you use a relative filepath as below. Also be sure to type the correct filename if you download a newer version of the csv file.
 
The thousands argument tells `pandas` that these are floats
```python
df = pd.read_csv('NADAC_as_of_2017-09-06.csv', thousands=',')
```

We can use `print(df.shape())` to get the size of our dataframe: `(24462, 12)`.


### Multiple NDCs for the same drug
There happens to be multiple NDCs (National Drug Code, a unique drug identifier) for each drug, these duplicates also seem to have the same prices anyways.

```
   NDC Description        NDC     NADAC_Per_Unit

ABACAVIR 300 MG TABLET	65862007360	1.9215
ABACAVIR 300 MG TABLET	51079020401	1.9215	
ABACAVIR 300 MG TABLET	51079020406	1.9215	
ABACAVIR 300 MG TABLET	68084002111	1.9215	
ABACAVIR 300 MG TABLET	378410591	1.9215	

```
Let's remove duplicate drugs from the file. 
```python
df = df.drop_duplicates(['NDC Description'], keep='first')
```

We can see that most of the entries were duplicates, `print(df.shape)` returns `(5412, 12)`.


Let's put our prices column into a python list.
```python
prices = df['NADAC_Per_Unit'].tolist()
```

Extra points for extra style.
```python
sns.set_style('whitegrid')
```

Here is the kernel density estimate function from seaborn, you can play with the `bw=` (bandwidth), increasing it will smooth out the estimation. `shade=True` colors under the line.

```python
sns.kdeplot(np.array(prices), bw=1, shade=True)
```

Add a title and labels.
```python
plt.title('Drug Price (NADAC) Probability Density')
plt.ylabel('Density')
plt.xlabel('Price')
```

Don't forget, seaborn requires matplotlib-style `sns.plt.show()`. Alternatively, if using Jupyter Notebook, you can use the magic command `%matplotlib inline` before calling `sns.kdeplot()`

```python
sns.plt.show()
```

As we can see, most drugs are relatively cheap, while a few are ***very*** expensive. Keep in mind that the X-axis is the price in USD ***per pill***

We can also make our plot log-scale to get a different look at things.

```python
sns.set_style('whitegrid')
sns.kdeplot(np.array(prices), bw=1, shade=True)
plt.title('Drug Price (NADAC) Natural Log Probability Density')
plt.ylabel('Density')
plt.xlabel('Natural Log Price')
plt.xscale('log')  # here's the magic
sns.plt.show()
```

This gives us a better look at the spread in the low-end of the spectrum.

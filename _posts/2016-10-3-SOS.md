title: Bored at the Secretary of State - A Monte Carlo Simulation with Python
---

Today I had to get my driver's license renewed, big 21st.
Oh great, the line is over 50 long.
Time to wait. And wait. And wait.
Hmm that's interesting *peers up at screen*

A realtime queue is displayed on the TVs above. 
Some people have signed in using their phone numbers, the last four digits of which are used to track your case.
About 10 of the 50 had actual ticket codes (letter-number-number-number).
Therefore about 40 have used their phone numbers instead.

*The speaker blurts out*
"NUMBER EIGHT FOUR THREE SEVEN PLEASE COME TO WINDOW NINE"

Hmm why wouldn't they just display the entire number?
Oh duh right, prank calls. A perfect thing to do while bored in this line.
Four digits doesn't seem like enough, what if I had the same number as someone else?
How would we know who was being called?

They must have thought about this possibility, right? 
Even if it is rare, the sheer volume of people entering SOS offices across the state means that two poor saps somewhere had to go up and ask.
Well, I guess that wouldn't be so bad. But still, could it happen?

*Begins scribbling*

Well, what's the probability that two dice rolls will turn up the same number

*scribbles six, six, thirty six, one out of six*

That wasn't so bad now what if there were 40 dice... with... 10,000 sides.
Yikes.

*Scribble scribble... runs out of page*

I'm not a statistician.
Eh, I could probably figure it out with some more research, but I am lazy and my time is valuable to me. So I'll let my computer do the thinking.

### Outline of the Problem

Each number is between 0000-9999.
The queue is 40 numbers (people) long.
What is the probability that when a number is called, two or more people will share that number and thus arrive at the counter confused.


### Let's Run an Experiment in Python 3

So I am slow, but my computer is fast.
The problem is simple to understand, but the math is not.
This sounds like a perfect problem to apply the Monte Carlo method.

Wouldn't it be great if, instead of calculating out dice rolls and probabilities, you could just roll 40 10,000-sided dice a hundred thousand times?
That's what a computer is for.

To begin, We'll start by defining what a dice roll is like in code.

```python
import random
print(random.randint(1,6)
```

That's pretty self-explanatory. randint pseudorandomly chooses a number from 1 to 6, with each having an equal probability.

How about saving multiple (40) dice rolls into a list? Oh and we'll also switch from a 6-sided die to a 10,000-sided one. This simulates the possible 4-digit numbers from 0000-9999.

```python
#40 people, each have a random 4 digit number
times_to_roll = 40
list = []
for x in range(0,times):
    list.append(random.randint(0,9999))
print(list)
```

This prints a list with the 40 random 4 digit numbers.
Let's turn it into a function so that our while loop towards the end isn't so messy.

Code thus far:

```python
import random

def rollnumber(times_to_roll):
   list = []
   for x in range(0,times_to_roll):
       list.append(random.randint(0,9999))
   return list
   
```

Let's write a function to check if any of the items in the list are identical, this will probably output "False" with such large digits. If you shorten the random.randint from (0,9999) to (1,6), you should get a "True" fairly often like if you were rolling a real die.

Anyways, here it is

```python
def check_for_copy_of_first(list):
    first = list[0]
    truth = first in list[1:]
    return truth
```

The function checks to see if any other element in the list matches the first. This simulates a number being called and subsequently checks if any other people in the queue have the same number. If so, it returns as "True"

Now Let's finish this off with an infinite loop that will continuously approach the true probability that when a number is called two or more people will share that number (get out of their seats). The loop performs 40 rolls and puts it into a list, it checks for copies of the first entry, then appends the Boolean data type (True/False) to a master list of all trials. Since True = 1, dividing the sum of the list by the number of elements (length) gives the proportion of trials that have a match.

```python
truth_list = []

while True:
    roll = rollnumber(40)
    same_num = check_for_copy_of_first(roll)
    truth_list.append(same_num)
    print(sum(truth_list)/len(truth_list))
```


### Full Source Code

The full code is here, I used an infinite loop so that it would progressively approach the true value and I could just leave the script running until I wanted to kill it. You can modify it to only print out a set number of digits or for a set amount of time by altering the "while True" loop.

```python
import random

def rollnumber(times):
   list = []
   for x in range(0,times):
       list.append(random.randint(0,9999))
   return list

def check_for_copy_of_first(list):
    first = list[0]
    truth = first in list[1:]
    return truth


truth_list = []

while True:
    roll = rollnumber(40)
    same_num = check_for_copy_of_first(roll)
    truth_list.append(same_num)
    print(sum(truth_list)/len(truth_list))
```


I got ~0.00395 or 0.395% 
It got hung up there for a while so I'm guessing that is close.
One problem is that the program slows down as the tally of true vs false increases and the list calculation gets larger.

Here is the code for a loop that runs 100,000 times and then outputs a graph. This takes about 55 seconds to run on my 4.5GHz i5-6600k.

```python
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import time

start = time.clock()

def rollnumber(times_to_roll):
   list = []
   for x in range(0,times_to_roll):
       list.append(random.randint(0,9999))
   return list


def check_for_copy_of_first(list):
    first = list[0]
    truth = first in list[1:]
    return truth

truth_list = []
prob_list = []

for i in range(0,100000):
    roll = rollnumber(40)
    same_num = check_for_copy_of_first(roll)
    truth_list.append(same_num)
    prob = sum(truth_list)/len(truth_list)
    prob_list.append(prob)
    if i % 5000 == 0:
        print(' ')
        print(prob)
        print('iteration:' + str(i))

end = time.clock()
print('took ' + str(end) + ' seconds')

plt.xkcd()
plt.plot(prob_list)
plt.ylabel('Probability')
plt.xlabel('Trial')
plt.suptitle('Probability that two people will respond when the last 4 digits of a phone number are called')
plt.show()
```

Let me know if I got anything wrong, I whipped this up pretty quick.

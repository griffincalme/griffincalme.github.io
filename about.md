I am Griffin Calme, a PharmD student at Wayne State University,
I like to solve problems using programming.

I'm a big fan of open source, open science/data, and Linux.
I'm also an avid reader of mostly science and some other non-fiction
genres, check out some of my favorite books 
[here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/59024006?shelf=read).

You can see my curriculum vitae [here](https://griffincalme.github.io/Griffin2017CV.pdf).
